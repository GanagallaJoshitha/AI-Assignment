# 🌐 Personal Portfolio — Joshitha Ganagalla

A clean, modern, fully responsive developer portfolio built with **HTML & CSS**, designed to showcase skills, experience, and contact links in a professional way.

## 🤖 AI Tool Usage

### **AI Tool Used**
**Cursor AI**

### **How the AI Tool Was Used**
- Generated the **initial boilerplate structure** for:
  - Header + Navigation
  - Hero section layout
  - Skills section grid
  - Footer structure

### **Manual Improvements Made by Me**
I reviewed, modified, and improved the AI-generated code in the following ways:

#### ✔ UI/Design Improvements
- Refined the color palette into a **professional neon-accent gradient**
- Removed all image placeholders to keep it clean and professional  
- Improved spacing, layout, padding, and alignment  
- Polished typography for readability  
- Added smooth animations and hover effects

#### ✔ Responsiveness Fixes
- Rewrote media queries for:
  - Desktop navigation  
  - Tablet 2-column grid  
  - Mobile hamburger menu  
  - 1-column skills layout  
- Ensured **no horizontal scroll** on any device

#### ✔ Code Quality Enhancements
- Cleaned repetitive CSS  
- Improved class names  
- Added mobile navigation script  
- Ensured semantic HTML for accessibility  

This makes the project AI-assisted, not AI-generated — the final result is crafted manually to look professional.
